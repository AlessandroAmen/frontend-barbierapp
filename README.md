The code isn't clean and doesn't follow best practices, as it's my first React Native project


Demo Project: Barber Appointment Booking App*

I'm excited to share with you my demo project, a mobile application built with React Native and Laravel, that allows users to book appointments with local barbers.

Technologies Used:

- React Native for mobile app development
- Laravel for backend API development
- TiDB as online database

Implemented Features:

- User login and registration
- Selection of local barber shop and barber (person)
- Calendar and available time slots for appointment booking
- Admin functionality to manage user roles and assign barber role

Check out the screenshots in the comments below and videos of the app to see it in action!

Objective:

The objective of this project is to demonstrate my coding skills and experience in developing mobile and backend applications.

What I'm looking for:

I'm looking for feedback and suggestions to improve my project and demonstrate my coding skills to potential employers or clients.

Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like to see more of my work!

The backend API is powered by Laravel, and you can explore its codebase here: https://github.com/AlessandroAmen/backend-backend-barbiere
